# Some instructions
This application requires the following:

	1. Use a database server such as WAMP or XAMPP (I used XAMPP).
	2. Create a database called lab1 with the columns 'Name', 'Email', 'Password', 'Address' and 'ProfilePhoto' all with a field size of about 255 and data type 'VARCHAR'.
	3. Create a class named util which has the database credentials i.e. DB_NAME, SERVER_NAME, USERNAME, PASSWORD.
	4. Make sure to specify the database you are using e.g. MySQL or PostGreSQL in the file db.php
	5. The file Register.php is a user class, which implements an interface with the name Account.
	6. Save this application on the htdocs folder in the xampp directory
